"The previous version is much better than this one. I used it for more than six years without any problem. But now I'm having a serious trouble with the updated app. I don't know why it takes him forever to refresh and load the home page once you sign in. And if it fails to load, it never recovers. I only see some UI changes. Really disappointed",2,2021-01-01,CBE
"The good thing is its simplicity to undertake the basic functions. Updates with improvements and fixes should have been released by now. Please fix. 5 years after last review… Issues with beneficiary are fixed. However, still unable to track transactions much less to download in appropriate formats. This feature got diminished in the latest update. Please improve and fix.",3,2023-03-15,CBE
The updated app is attractive and is working very well. Forced to revise my previous rating of 2 star to 4 star. Hope it will keep on working! Rated it excellent for the past years. Revised my review after it keeps on crashing in 2019 and installing it for a second time in less than 3 months. Please work on the problems.,4,2020-07-25,CBE
"I love this app. It's simple to use and syncs fast. The only issue I had was the balance shows only what's on the ledger, there is no way to tell what the actual balance is. I learn about the difference between the two balance types the hard way on an ATM machine. I would love to see that fixed in your next update.",5,2021-09-25,CBE
"It is a service that is not expected from such a large institution. I saw that your work is very complicated. The user does not understand well your application. In general, you have many problems. This application is not convenient for the end user. For instance I can't access my account from abroad what I depsited amount and transfer from my account to any any one .It is a shame.",1,2024-10-16,CBE
"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services.",2,2025-05-25,CBE
"this new update(Mar 19,2025) is great in fixing bugs, stability and smooth experience I'll give u that but it came with a big shortcoming which is not allowing to take screenshot. I can't screenshot neither my balance nor the transaction or anything within the app, i understand it's for security reasons but please bring that back, allow us to take screenshot we need that. Thanks.",4,2025-03-20,CBE
"Good job to the CBE team on this mobile app! It's designed in a way that's simple and intuitive to navigate, which is great for everyone. It effectively handles the essential banking tasks I need to perform regularly. It's a practical and reliable tool that makes everyday banking much more convenient. Thank you for this useful application.",5,2025-04-04,CBE
this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.,5,2025-05-31,CBE
as if the update of march 19 i can't take a screenshot in the app. i can just save it as file and that is so annoying. i used to save all screenshot in my gallery in one folder now with the extra steps added i have to save the file go to file and then screenshot it. the solution is to allow the screenshot to be save in to gallery automatically. i wish you give this review attention and resolve the issue shortly.,2,2025-03-19,CBE
"Old version was very friendly to use. Now we can't see the #Reason The #transaction history (very limited) and now it crash every time it's opened. More over, the last update prevents us from taking #screenshots. Thanks for the developers as they are getting more stupid than ever.",1,2025-03-21,CBE
Taking away the screenshot of the receipt is just silly. Worse is tbe download button putting a copy of the screenshot - which you prevented to be taken - in tbe downloads folder where we cant attach directly from Whatsapp. Millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment / transfer yet you make that harder for everyone? I have every user contacts the developer or manager who made this awful decision.,1,2025-03-20,CBE
"Recently there is big problem when sending to safaricom, telebir, and even to cbebirr wallet could anybody who is responsible fix it, it's very frustrating it's been 5 days and my money hasn't been returned it takes it out of my account but doesn't send it to my mpesa update- they have just corrected it and sent me back the money but still I'm afraid now to send again",2,2025-05-31,CBE

"It's very good in reminding the account numbers you have been used, but Need to show recipient history whenever you want to present it.or it has to have a search on options for a spesfic time you want to look for receipts with out going for account details at bank. if you lost your receipt without downloading it and need to look sometime a while you can't get in simple search on the app.",1,2025-02-15,CBE

"I’ve been using the CBE mobile banking app, and overall, I appreciate its features. However, I’ve noticed that when I turn on the developer options on my device, the app stops functioning properly. It would be great if you could look into this issue, as I often need to access developer settings for other applications. Thank you for your attention to this matter!",1,2025-01-29,CBE
"Very good application. However, I have one functionality recommendation. What if you let the app transfer money to any telebirr account as for MPESA? By the way, I am not the only one to ask this. Thank you!",4,2025-04-01,CBE

"In the previous, I gave 4 🌟 for this app based on my evaluation. This app was without biometric security and may be exposed to cheaters unexpectedly. It is solved now. You can add verification security on the setting app. But there is something problem still with verification. It must prevent logging in without correct input fingerprint.",5,2024-12-20,CBE
"I don't understand the reason, why I need to disable developer options to access the app, it has no security risks nor does it hinder the app's functionalities. This goes out to the dev, I hope your life is filled with inconveniences.",1,2025-04-02,CBE
before it was smooth and good. this time after the new update in 2025 i can not make screenshot of my recite. even the downlod button is very delayed in putting my recite in my gallery for simple proof. please fix this i am unable to show proof of payment to my clients. thankyou.,3,2025-04-04,CBE
"my first frequent experience of cbe app is critical-time failure such as suspending payment on air for 2-5 days with zero explanation, deducting from sender account without depositing to the receiver act. Another fatal error by the banking company as a whole (not the app itself though) is forced-banking with corporations without consent of employers-users of the corresponding corporations",2,2025-04-21,CBE
Please bring back the screenshot option. The screenshot download option takes like 15 second appear in gallery and most people don't know about it.,3,2025-03-25,CBE
"The recent update automatically turns the developers option on, and when one starts the app, a message pops up saying the app does not work with the developers option on. So, one has to go to the settings and manually turn the developers option off. Otherwise the app doesn't work.",3,2025-01-01,CBE
"The review page keeps loading, and even sync is completed. The history page always shows old/unknown transactions. ...... Edited: I guess the loading page means it expires and needs to go to the nearest bank and ask for an extension for another 3 years. Upgrade to 3 stars .",3,2024-12-30,CBE
"First this app was pretty good and well connection while transferring money, but now there's no such a worst mob app ever while transferring money it corrupts due to the network and took the amount of money you were transferring from your account then after seconds interruptions it's shows that the money is transferred (this case happens especially to telebirrr wallet) then after you report the issue to the CBE customer service they refund your money to your CBE account after 3-5 days.",2,2025-01-09,CBE
Two step verification update is fake (meaningless). Why because the app gives you an option of to use pin while requesting two step verification step. 🔐 This updated app is not differ than the previous one in case of security & safegaurding users.👹👹💀💀 The other features of the app are best and easy to use it.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,1,2025-03-06,CBE
What an absolutely terrible update. No screenshots and you still have this stupid restriction on developer options. WHAT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE ACTUALLY DEVELOPERS!!!!!! At this point telebirr just wins the game 100%. CBE. Do. Better!,1,2025-03-21,CBE
Really! this app is more simple to use at any time in every where also it's transaction quality between the users within the transaction receipt as abank that means this app is our bank on hand in mobile frankly I proud on this bank digital. I have no word to wrote ...... but it's have weakness on poor connection.,5,2025-03-31,CBE
"The app is full of bugs here and there, perhaps it's from the backend side idk. For instance the transaction history you see on top is one made a couple of months ago and you have to refresh until you reach the top. it's just so bizarre. And you can't even search for a transaction you made. Someone with a lot of transactions will find it annoying. Even simple things like localising dates to Amharic dates are now correctly implemented.",2,2025-02-25,CBE
It made life alot easier. I cant even imagine having to make all those transactions in person. So this app was crucial for me. Very good app. well done.,5,2025-04-03,CBE
It used to be the best bank app in Ethiopia. But now using it is a terrible experience. For every transaction it shows an error message. Making a simple payment requires 5 to 6 trials to complete.,1,2025-01-31,CBE
I'm sad guys what are you doing? Why did you add the screenshot restriction to the app? You just made it worse it was a great value to us. You need to rethink it. i will change the 1 star rating when you resolve the issue.,1,2025-03-22,CBE
If any developer is reading this please fix the screenshot functionality or at least the download button should work flawlessly without me touching it twenty times.,1,2025-05-05,CBE
Its good but we need an option of choosing a specific period to get a historique of transactions. For example when i want to check my previous transactions i only get few transactions. Thank you.,2,2025-01-30,CBE
well designed! Fixing bugs & two step verification with biometric... simply it's great!,5,2025-05-06,CBE
always disappointing ! especially the iOS one !! some similar local applications are extremely superior to this application!! Really disappointing!,1,2025-05-17,CBE
"As an app developer, I rely on Developer Mode to build and test apps, but this app blocks access entirely if it's enabled. This restriction is unnecessary and makes it impossible for developers to use the service. Instead of outright blocking, consider implementing enhanced security measures that don't alienate professionals who need this setting. Please reconsider this policy.",2,2024-12-31,CBE
it is good app. But you have integrate cbe with cbe birr. to allow cardless withdrawal directly from our accout!,4,2025-03-31,CBE
Doesn't work properly. It crashes some many times. commercial bank of Ethiopia not only the application but also sending money to own CBE birr doesn't get your money in your bank account. forcefully you must wait 3-5 days to get your money back to your account. walk up CBE the world is going to decentralized finance.,1,2025-03-26,CBE
"I am not exaggerating when I say that this application is one of the biggest players in the banking industry. It has simplified a lot of things for the user, even if the bank is in his pocket. But my opinion is (1), when we transfer money, there is a word limit on the (Note) at the end. Why can't we write our reason briefly? I don't understand why it is limited. On the other hand, there is no limit on the bank. Could you explain this? (2), when we pay for water, why is the code not mentioned",5,2025-03-29,CBE
"I have seen lots of great updates right here, especially the 2FA using the biometric security technique, I suggest you work on minimising app crashing due to the accumulation of cache, very little cache crash it.",4,2025-02-03,CBE
"Add customer service please other than calling 951. Why would you have a mobile app but not an online text-based customer service? Why? Disappointing And I will never use the top-up feature again, I have been trying to recharge my safaricom balance but your app would say time out and then credit my account but never recharge my balance, why? Where is my money? Do you expect me to call 951 at midnight?",2,2025-02-08,CBE
"Why on earth is CBE telling me to turn off developer mode? As the name clearly states, it's for developers, not for CBE to dictate. There are countless financial apps out there that work just fine without demanding such an unnecessary restriction. If your app can’t handle developer mode, that’s a you problem. Fix your code instead of disabling features that have absolutely nothing to do with you.",2,2025-01-25,CBE
"I really like this app as it is being updated from time to time and includes multiple payment options. In particular, giving a receipt makes it even more preferable. However, when it is refreshed, it does not show the history of credit and deposit in order and, I am of the opinion that it is better if the recent history is fixed respectively according to the transaction date in the future because there is a problem of confusion.",3,2024-09-12,CBE
"I like the application very much because it is user friendly and makes transactions easiest, especially for business matters. But, these few days I faced difficulties of opening it. I tried to uninstall and re install the app, and re verified at the nearest cbe center. But still failed to use all the functions. It says 'none available'. Any suggestions please!",3,2023-06-05,CBE
"Most of the time, in the 'Recents' button the app becomes stuck and doesn't show up details of transactions and doesn't even scroll down; should be solved. Second, the app doesn't save the last pop-up screen when a transaction is complete. Third, there is no telebirr transfer to other person option and the app by default lets you to only own telebirr transfer.",4,2022-10-06,CBE
"It's a great app. I've been using this app since the bank launched it. As a long-term user, I would like to point out things that need to be improved. 1. Deleting money transfer history should be the user's choice. 2. There should be an option to download an in-depth transfer history for each transfer activity , just as there is posiblity to download a single time transfer recit. Do that and get 5 star.",3,2022-03-18,CBE
"This app has several issues based on my experience. Below are the problems that I encountered: 1. The app frequently crashes. 2. It only shows a limited transaction record history (25 transactions). 3. You can't access the transaction records after 8:00 pm and on Sundays. 4. It displays a ""payment failed"" message. It would be greatly appreciated if you could address these issues",1,2024-08-25,CBE
1 star because I have to visit my bank for new installation of the app and reactivation takes about 45 to 60 minutes with there long queue and system failures. Learn from telebire app and give options to customers to apt out of this ridiculous security feature. Second why is there no customization in the settings for displaying which account I want displayed in the first section rather that slide to my main account every time. You are making us pay a monthly subscription. Bare minimum is not it,1,2025-02-26,CBE
"My experience with this app has been outstanding so far,but sometimes it has a hard time connecting with network and makes it hard to make transactions. Apart from that it's amazing.",4,2024-12-17,CBE
"I have been using this app for almost four years now. In the beginning, it was working fine. Sometime later, it gets difficult to create a connection to my account, and could not manage to make and see transactions on my account. After updating it lately, Jul 2020, I was glad this app came with some user interface improvements, and the connection was quite fast. Not longer than two weeks, the app starts to get stuck, and it cannot even show me the UI properly. As a result, I have a useless app on my cell phone, hoping that [you] will soon come with updates.",2,2020-09-03,CBE
"Application UI and new features are better than the previous version. I found a minor bugs though. I couldn't transfer to an account from the beneficiary list, it says None Available; There is still so much to do with the localization; Instead of ሰኔ it says ጁን and more like this; date conversion is missing also. If this minor things are fixed it will be much better.",3,2020-11-05,CBE
"It is a good and progressive app through the updates. I think the app should further solve its bugs like 1. It doesn't download or share attachment on android 12 and 11, it used to work on android 10. 2. Sometimes transactions seem like they have failed and there are no records, but the transactions actually have passed this is a very serious issue, because people will try the transaction again which will end up doubling the payment.",4,2022-09-15,CBE
"With each update the app is getting slower and slower, specially when requesting transaction history. And I wish the logging process could be done easily. When someone changes a phone, it makes it mandatory to consult the branch and that makes it not to be self assisted. Hope you could fix it. Please add an option of transferring to other TeleBirr numbers other than the ""Own telebirr"" option. It id very limiting now a days",4,2023-08-11,CBE
"Absolutely the best app! It works flawlessly, anytime and anywhere.",5,2025-04-17,CBE
"The CBE mobile banking app is a time-saver, but it needs several improvements, like adding fingerprint authentication. It's risky when people see me entering my PIN. Additionally, the fees are unreasonable. You could learn from Tele Birr, which adjusts fees based on the transaction amount. However, the CBEMB app charges a flat 10 birr fee for amounts between 5 and 1000 birr, which I think is unfair.",2,2024-09-04,CBE
"The app is awesome. But there are many things to highlight.For example, When spending money from the account , a confirmation text message must be sent to the account holder. Also the fact that, the PIN is only four digits is not safe enough for security, if it is more than eight digits and includes numbers and symbols, it will be cool.",3,2023-01-29,CBE
"Still needs development on several features.... For example - bank statements available online. The text feature of available balance and debited/credited notifications is very old school and involves too much digital trail. App doesn't always work, could be due to network issues in Ethiopia though. Another major issue is an error message is displayed when transferring from CBE to other banks. Ive almost lost a few thousands doing this once. Always cross check your balances.",1,2024-08-27,CBE
Recently app keeps closing and the notification after says this app has a bug. Can you make an update please,4,2025-03-31,CBE

nice app suitable to use it. the only weak side is it need data connections and hoping will be fixed to offline i gave 4 rate,4,2025-04-05,CBE
"I really love this app,it is amazing. It is more flexible than any other banks app. The only and main problem that I encountered with this app is,if it is uninstalled from this devices, I have to go to the bank and mostly the specific barank the account is opened to reconfigur again. This is very unpractical in most cases,since people are traveling and very busy in their day to day activities. Kindly consider to change this option.",5,2023-09-11,CBE

"URGENT FIX REQUIRED!!! The app does not work anymore! Account balance is not displayed. Trying to use any service on the app shows error ""None available"". What is the point of an internet/mobile banking app if you cannot carry out banking services from your fingertips?

"It's full of crashing features, can't sync real time need 3,4 touching doesn't work many times. In fact it's not working now I'm afraid if I uninstalled it I will be forced to go to the branch to activate it again so here I'm stuck with the app unable to access my money",1,2024-03-14,CBE
Poor application most times it says error while sending then it actually sent money so u have to double check if its an error or it sent cash. recent transaction don't update as fast sometimes it even misplaces date and bring forth a transaction done a day or 2 back at the top.the only thing remotely good is the UI interface,1,2024-04-12,CBE
"This app is not set up for diaspora users. It works fine until you needed a new verification code, or you change your cell phone and try to use the app on the new phone. You will not be able to get the verification key that it is asking for just for changing your phone. It requires you to go the nearest branch to get the verification key.

That's rediocoulus. - This application seems like it's a transfer application, not a bank application. I should be able to do more things such as viewing bank statements and more....",3,2024-08-21,CBE
The fast and easy to use app there is nothing to deny aboutt that... but it has a serious issue on showing transaction history like if i send or receive money i ll find the transaction history after a day.

"I am so disappointed because the application doesn't clearly show how many birr it will charge for every transaction rather than just deducted the money , as a user we should have the right to know the amount of money that is going to be deducted. It is a very deceptive tactic , it should be improved immediately.",1,2024-12-15,CBE
"It's a beautiful app. But especially when transferring from one account to another, if a receipt is prepared stating the name of the sender and the name of the recipient and the amount of the money.

Shame to see one of the biggest bank in east africa. Have this app 1 .you try to send money.. it will fail on the way you try again and your money have been sent Twice. Then you have to ask the Receiver to send the money back to you. 2. Try to refresh to see your recent transaction and it will show old transaction. Clearly they don't care . You can get your statement easily via telebirr. But cbe you have to go to branch and beg sometimes Bribe the managers to get your own bank statement . Shame,1,2023-11-23,CBE
