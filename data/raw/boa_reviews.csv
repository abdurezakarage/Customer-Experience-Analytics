"I have a fitayah account, a type of interest free account, and because their system is unable to process anything for people like me I can't see any of my accounts in the account list on any transaction, although I can see it when performing security actions or checking my balance, as such this app is as useless to me as the previous one. Unbelievable",1,2024-02-18,BOA
Can you please just make it functional. I don't think anyone cares how good it looks if not a single functionality works. Plus it's not even aestheticaly nice. The loading animated icon has white irregular edges because the logo wasn't cut out correctly. The app doesn't work at all. It doesn't even login. It gets stuck on login just showing the logo animation and blames the issue on connectivity. Connectivity is fine and the proof is that this review is posted.,1,2024-04-15,BOA
"Developers/ the company takes too long to update the app, and throughout that process, the app is basically useless. We can't send money or even be able to check our account. They even take it down from the Play Store for a while. This whole process usually takes them 3 to 5 days. This is very disappointing. It is an improvement from the previous version of the app, but they still have a long way to go to compete with the likes of CBE. Transferring to other banks sometimes doesn't work.",2,2024-05-03,BOA
"This app is a joke. It crashes more than it works, takes forever to load, and half the features are just decorative at this point. Can‚Äôt log in, can‚Äôt transfer money, can‚Äôt even check my balance without it bugging out. To the developer: Are you actually trying to make this work, or is this some kind of social experiment to test our patience? Did you build this in your sleep? Because it definitely looks like it. If this is your idea of a functional app, maybe consider a different career pathüôè",1,2025-05-21,BOA
It keeps showing this pop up to turn off developer options even tho it's off! I had to turn on and then off to make it work! This is a horrible experience and needs a fix asap! Plus kinda slow.,1,2025-04-19,BOA
"Edit: New bug, app not letting me type in my otp codes. Shameful Why does this app not allow me to use it while having developer options on? Did y'all consider that I might, perhaps, be an actual developer? Why am I expected to toggle the option on and off just to bank (restarting my phone when I do)? Why is the message labled as somthing that will ""smoothen"" the experience? This is like the most ""security consultant"" thing to implement in an app. Please invest in actual security, not this mess.",1,2025-03-12,BOA
"Hello, I‚Äôm facing a problem with the BOA Mobile app. Every time I enter my phone number and password, the app crashes and shows an error that says ‚ÄúBoaMobile closed because this app has a bug.‚Äù I tried updating, reinstalling, and clearing cache, but nothing worked. Please fix this bug in the next update. I really need access to my account. Thank you.",1,2025-06-03,BOA
"i entered incorrect security question by mistake boa app lock pin forever, why is there no other options? ?? i contacted different branchs more then 4times but they didn't able to solve this issue .",5,2025-05-10,BOA
"I‚Äôm giving this app one star because there are no options below that. My experience has been incredibly frustrating due to the extremely long loading times, and the app even closes automatically at times. People choose mobile banking for its convenience, but this app is far too time-consuming, making it the worst I‚Äôve used. I hope improvements are made to enhance the user experience.",1,2024-12-07,BOA
i would have given it a lower if it was possible because it crush so much and it take the bank so long to fix the bug,1,2025-04-08,BOA
"This is the best app; many features are awesome, but it should work without the need to turn off the developer options. I'm tired of having to constantly switch the developer options off and on. I've been expressing my struggles about this. I have precious settings enabled in the developer options, and to open the App Boa app, I have to turn them off. Please help us, Abyssinia Bank. I hope you can provide an update soon.",4,2024-12-08,BOA
"I don't know what is wrong with BOA as a bank in general. It's been going backwards since last year or so. The app is a disaster to use in every possible way. Not stable to log in and very slow to perform transactions, couldn't take a screenshot (or can't even find the pictures even using its save screenshot option). Most of the time, it fails to perform transactions and so on. Simply, it's the worst!",1,2024-08-03,BOA
What's wrong with App. this days? it doesn't working properly. 1) it's VERY SLOW & doesn't open. it's very Annoying. 2) most of the time it says repeatedly Please try it again or try it later but again and again it doesn't open or work. 3) repeatedly it says something went wrong then it off the screen. I've updated the App. when it needed but nothing changed. üëâPLEASE if it has some issues with the App. Please fix it otherwise I'm going to uninstall it.,2,2024-05-08,BOA
Worst App ever. Totally unreliable. And it didn't work at all for the last 4 months.,1,2025-05-18,BOA
"What an awesome app! It is supper easy to use with very attractive GUI. But there are some problems to be addressed: (1) It crashes frequently and requires mobile cache to be cleared to relaunch. (2) Automatic OTP input is good. But fix the manual activation option, too. (3) It does not boot fast. (4) There are minor errors during the installation. (5) Color contrast: In the transactions menu, the credit accounts should be in dark green than light green. The debit accounts should be in dark red.",5,2024-02-06,BOA
"Terrible Bank Experience It‚Äôs unbelievable that with all the modern technology, this bank still struggles with even basic transactions. The app constantly crashes, services are limited, and every time I try to transfer money or load Telebirr, there‚Äôs a huge delay. I have to wait 5 days for failed transactions to be refunded! Even USSD is unreliable. They‚Äôve put me in embarrassing situations countless times, and customer care never fixes anything. I‚Äôve switched banks, and you should too!",1,2024-10-14,BOA
"I have a worst experience while using this mobile application through out the year. Most of the time it fails to ""Login"" or automatically closed the app. And also it takes so much loading time (5 minutes +) trying to access the internal services. Sometimes also while transferring within and to other bank also fails. So, BOA please fix your app.",1,2024-11-29,BOA
"the app isn't working after it asked me the password it starts loading, but it doesn't open",3,2025-04-20,BOA
"It crashes frequently. It launches on Android 8.1 but I don't think it actually works on versions less than 10. If so, it shouldn't be available for download by such devices to begin with, like many other finance apps are not. It was so much better three months ago, upgrades should be for the better.",1,2024-09-06,BOA
"It can't actively on initialization, it says incorrect OTP getting the exact OTP",1,2025-03-29,BOA
Bad app . it stuck when you open and noting WORKS.,1,2025-04-23,BOA
"This app future is good, but there is problems with apps to reset and activate it, which is difficult even to the branch staffs, and it takes too long times to active at the branch plus most of the time high expected failure of activation after process at the counter and OTP sent not work",1,2025-05-06,BOA
"Why the app doesn't allow to update the previous version. In addition to this, when I install the new version and try to activate, the app doesn't allow to write the activation OTP code to the screen. I have received the OTP password from telegram and email. Would you please fix this bug. Thank you",1,2024-02-03,BOA
"This app has been found useless while I compared with the first version of IB12111...that was very good, you guys what is the matter with you. You are far from the technology and the competetor's digital product through convenience, reliable, easeness _-dashen, cbe, zemen... they are doing well! share their experience and be able to satisfy your esteemed customers including me. unless you will be down soon!",1,2024-04-29,BOA
"I will give only one star, because it faced with multiple of problems. 1. The app is not as fast as the other banks App, for e.g like CBE 2. The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!",1,2025-01-03,BOA
This app is incredibly frustrating to use. It‚Äôs filled with issues that make it difficult to navigate and complete tasks efficiently. I‚Äôve never encountered such a poorly designed banking application before. It needs significant improvements to enhance user experience. It deserves a vey low rating.,1,2024-09-26,BOA
"The version 24.04.26 is not opening on any of my devices. I noticed this issue on my friend's Android 9 phone and also on my Samsung Android 12 phone. Even after weekly updates, the newest version is not working properly. Please provide a stable version update, as I prefer the older version of the app from the new one.",1,2024-05-04,BOA
Very unprofessional and mischievous bank in my opinion. I have had several occasions but recently I used Abyssinia Card to withdraw money and it was deducted from my account but despite reporting several times they said they are processing it but I learned yesterday that since it has been 3 months the bank has decided to include it in their income. How absurd. If you can avoid this bank.,1,2024-12-06,BOA
"So BoA, your last application was horrible and buggy. And we thought ""finally!! a functional new app with better UI."" But It didn't last long, a non existent connection error at login.... Please just fix your app to the simplest functional form and it would be up to your other service standards.",1,2024-04-21,BOA
It has been a while since you guys started giving the mobile app service but still couldn't get it to work. I'm sure you know that it doesn't work already but not sure if you're lazy or incompetent to fix it. You are losing business because of this. Complacency will have consequences.,1,2024-12-10,BOA
it doesn't work period z slowest mobile banking ever i would rather use *815#,1,2025-04-01,BOA
OMG this is like the worst mobile banking app ever. I have many different mobile banking app from different banks but this is the worst so far. It says it has connection issue when I have wifi or data connection and while I'm using other social media apps. It keeps asking me for update once like every week and takes forever to load like I have to wait at least 10 minutes to login and another 10 min to see my balance.,1,2024-05-02,BOA
"Was working fine for 2 days then Error the request was not successful please check your connectivity or try again my connection works perfectly i reinstalled the app called support multiple times all of them said it's a system problem be patient it has been a week since then, called again they even dared to say the problem is your phone restart it which i did but still the same other banking apps work perfectly but this my experience with this app, horrible the whole system is bad",1,2024-02-14,BOA
"This is a much better app from BOA, easy to activate with ATM credit info, that helps someone like myself who already forgots previous PIN No or IB password. Apps runs fast unlike the previous versions. I hope you don't ruin it with unnecessary update. Please notify customers to use this app through their SMS.",5,2024-01-18,BOA
"The app does not work well from abroad, there have been continuous upgrades and updates that are very interruptive and non-responsive. Staff do not have the technical capabilities to support whereas the support number and online support are never available.",1,2024-02-12,BOA
This app is not efficient and can't be used for people outside Ethiopia. I am not able to enter back my OTP code into the App screen as it gets frozen and nothing can be done. Also the login screen forces to enter a local cell phone in Ethiopia and a PIN number. Those of us who live abroad are left out. The previous application with BoA Authenitcater was working efficiently and I was also able to login using my LapTop. I recommend the Application to use login user name & email instead of Ph#.,1,2024-02-23,BOA
"Be careful of using this app to transfer large sums of money. Recently I can't top up my mobile card, can't pay tickets, can't transfer money to Telebirr. The *815# works but what's the use of an app if we're using USSD. It will refund your mobile top up days after failing to top up but I wouldn't want to risk that. I'm a big fan of BoA but I wouldn't recommend this app. üëé",1,2024-05-15,BOA
"Very poor app. It crashes every time, doesn't load properly, and you can't even buy airtime. The programming is subpar. Please take lessons from other online banking apps. I would give it a zero if I could!!",1,2024-05-10,BOA
"The app doesnot allow to transfer from foreign currency accounts to local currency accounts , it says transaction not allowed , please check it and also it is difficult to activate the app from abroad countries since the otp doesn't reach by sms and it uses email, it doesn't allow manual otp input and the email hardly received , please review your app and make an update !!!",2,2024-03-22,BOA
"When we come to use mobile banking app this app is the WOREST one. Who made this app? Why? im almost forget to use it While the app right infront to my phone. I preffered to go branch office rather than to use it. Let alone for transaction or other service for simple purpose to check my balance i used to call for the bank 'call center' rather than to open for this difficult app. It need high speed internet service, it stop service for simple interuption of the network, after transfer the 1/2",1,2024-02-13,BOA
"Please add an option to manually input the OTP. I am residing outside of Ethiopia. I encountered difficulty accessing my account following the recent update (change) of your mobile banking app. Unfortunately, I am unable to activate the app on my mobile device. During the activation process, the app prompts for an OTP, which I can receive via Telegram. However, there is no option to manually input the OTP. I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter and activating my account",3,2024-02-03,BOA
"It's been two months now, I cannot do any transaction using this app. It's really disappointing. I am using bank of Abyssinia currently because it's the nearest bank to my work place. The bank is turning to the worst bank in the country day by day. They always respond to customers that they are updating their system all year long, I think that's what they train their customer service operators to do.",1,2024-06-26,BOA
"The worst mobile banking app! It doesn't load (seems like with the perfect WiFi and data connection it still manages to have network issues), when you finally get into the app, it makes it so hard more than it should be to send money.",1,2024-05-31,BOA
"Playstore need to have some option to give 0 stars because this application right here, deserve exactly that, imagine being one of the biggest banks In the country and can't manage to have good mobile application in the Era of mobile money, you guys are in the brink of collapse you better make it right real quick or you gonna be 10 meters down to the grave. DON'T USE THIS APP, IT'S WASTE OF TIME.",1,2024-05-21,BOA
"The updated version of this app is just time wasting. It doesn't work with 2G/3G network.require log in frequently,not fast as much as possible.automatic log out are the bad features of this app",1,2024-04-13,BOA
"This is terrible app. What the hell is your problem. Passwords can't be entered manually. I'm abroad. I don't have my Ethiopian Sim. I'm receiving the activation code via telegram. But you locked the system not to accept the activation OTP manually. Hence, I can't see my accounts, I can't make transactions etc.... how can you not think of this in advance.... now I'm in a terrible situation. I can't know what is going on with my account. WOULD YOU FIX IT NOW.... NOT TOMORROW or THE DAY AFTER...",1,2024-02-16,BOA
"This app is trash, it's not working for the past 3-4 days. I've to go to the bank to send money to other banks. Plus the app keeps crashing since the last update. BOA as a bank is deteriorating! This has to change.",1,2024-04-30,BOA
"The worst mobile banking app ever!!! I have tried to transfer 25,000 from my BOA account to my CBE and it still hasn't reached my CBE account yet. When I tried contacting customer support they just tell me it's a problem with the system. I have waited 48 hours and I still haven't received my money. Bank of Abyssinia the worst bank and system, I don't recommend this app or bank to anyone.",1,2024-03-01,BOA
"This is the most stupid app I've seen, why would I turn off developer mode just because you can't make your app secure, this clearly indicates the app has very poor implementation and unskilled developers.. There are a lot of people who need developer option for different reasons. Please for the sake of the bank, fix this thing... Even the most secure international banking apps don't require it. Not to mention the lag and crashes",1,2024-07-12,BOA

"This app takes too long time to be opened. And even it is not working simply as other banks application. Why this app does not give a digital invoice. Even, I am not able to find where the screeshot is kept after transaction. So, please the developer should fix all these.",1,2024-08-07,BOA
"I've never seen a very worst mobile banking system like this, i lost 37000 birr because of your delay transaction system, i called 8397 and they told me stay for confirmation but, after i changed my mind and waiting for confirmation call to cancel the process they sent it with out my approval, so please don't use the mobile banking system please",1,2024-04-23,BOA
"BOA is unreasonably holding and delaying transactions for more than a day, even transactions within the same bank itself. This is a huge gap that I observed in BOA mobile banking. I didn't experience this kind of challenge while having transactions in other banks' mobile banking platforms. After waiting so long, I called your customer support team and the response they gave me was ""it was the system that holds the transaction & will be released on working days"". This is not totally fair.",1,2024-09-15,BOA

Worst mobile banking app I ever experienced I was blaming other apps but comparing with this they're too much better!!!! It clashes it takes much longer time to login while loading in short it's a complete of trash,1,2025-03-06,BOA
i have went to the bank so many times because i couldn't make any transaction i can only see my balance nothing else so what is the point of having mobile banking if i can't make any transaction with it please work in that,1,2025-03-21,BOA
"Worst App it ain't allowing yo activate not even in the nearest branch are able to activate it. I have been client of the bank for 10years. What is this BoA? As we know it being a leading in simplifying banking service this App needs to be fixed. Then we will give it better rate,",1,2024-02-13,BOA
"Great graphics, but why my music have to stop when I open this app? Make it make sense. But overall, it's good, but also needs too much data just to load this app. We might need a lite version of this.",3,2024-02-15,BOA
"the app used to run fine, but now it takes like forever to even open the main dashboard and sometimes it just crashes on its own. you guys gotta step it up. we need this app to be way faster",1,2024-06-27,BOA

"I can't believe in this day and age, one of the major banks of the country can't seem to understand that having a working mobile payment option is a **MUST** to survive. I have decided to move my accounts to CBE and Awash because of this. Can't be bothered with this useless app.",1,2024-07-04,BOA
I'm disappointed with the recent changes to this app. Disabling developer options for functionality seems unnecessary. The previous version offered a more user-friendly experience.,1,2024-06-06,BOA

My advice for whoever reading is go look for other bank(awash bank is a great example). This bank won't even allow you to access your money when you want. It has bad servers which don't work(respond) on time.,1,2024-05-11,BOA
